## Stage A : Introduction to Python for Machine Learning
My Grade: 80.0% School: OneSchool

Electric Utilities report a huge amount of information to government and public agencies. They include very granular data on fuel burned,
electricity generated, power plant usage patterns, plant capacity factors and emissions from greenhouse gases. However, this data is not well
documented and sometimes they are provided in a format that makes it difficult to understand. This course explores how machine learning
techniques can be an invaluable tool for solving one of the grand challenges posed to humanity - climate change. At the end of this course, you
will work on cleaning, wrangling, exploring, providing summary statistics and interesting visualisations on a public utility data containing
millions of rows and tens of files in structured format.
